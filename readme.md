## Resume Categorization

## Steps:
- First install the dependencies used in this project `pip install -r requirements.txt`

- Next run the script file using `python3 script.py $directory path$` The directory path should contain a batch of resumes in pdf format. It will not be processed if the resume is not in pdf format. I have assumed only pdf files to process the resumes.
